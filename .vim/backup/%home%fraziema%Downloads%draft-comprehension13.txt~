I feel that the most important implication is the need to "use assessment during instruction." The feedback provided through assessment during instruction is beneficial for both teacher and student. For students, goal-setting, self-regulation, and self-efficacy are important sets of skills for learning (that I find lacking in many of my students). Students need to have a clear goal to work towards, which assessment provides feedback for measuring progress towards and for developing goals. Students need to develop self-assessment of learning (monitoring and management of their learning), which the assessment during instruction also provides feedback for. Students also need to see the importance of motivation and effort; these assessments provide evidence of the importance of the effort the student puts in, and the motivation the student has to learning.


In my classes, I tend to put pre-assessments at the very beginning of the course, that addresses one fundamental skill, and some that address interests and learning preferences. In physics, it is important to be able to solve systems of equations and to do the algebraic manipulations needed to find solutions to physics problems; I have found that some students (especially since the pandemic) struggle with this, and many will claim they have never seen it (despite having taken the algebra courses that teach it.) This pretest lets me know who will need more support with the mathematical work and which students can look at more advanced topics. Other preassessments inform my use of spreadsheets and programming in data collection and problem-solving; some students will be very interested in using numerical methods to solve problems, while others may demonstrate other learning preferences 


Gifted students can be gifted in distinct / specific domains, and rather than being high-intelligence/high ability, they can be creatively gifted, or gifted in leadership or task commitment. Because of the varied nature of gifted students, we need to use varied forms of assessment that are authentic -- the assessments need to assess that a skill can be used in context and for real-world purpose. (Most of the students I know recognize that no career (other than teaching) asks people to solve problems that are already solved; traditional assessments don't look like how skills are actually put to use ) Letting students take part in designing / developing assessments does two things: it helps students take ownership of their learning -- they know expectations / standards and are motivated to meet them (because they are their own expectations / standards), and it allows the assessments to address the varied nature of gifted students (as there will be contributions from many students.)

I feel as if it is particularly applicable, as gifted students can have a misunderstanding of what learning is -- some of my students will think that learning is showing what you know, rather than increasing what you know; and they will try to do only the things that they find easy. They can view learning as assessment-oriented; they want to maximize outcomes on assessments, rather than developing talents and skills. I feel that it is important to demonstrate to students the importance of being wrong as part of learning; I try to demonstrate problem solving in an authentic manner, in which I can make the mistakes that students can make (it is difficult when one has practiced in the field for decades, but showing students more realistic and ill-formed problems helps.)  I also try to give positive feedback for progress towards a solution, even praise for attempting the problem; giving specific feedback that helps to be more successful on the next attempt and is positive towards not 'refusing to fail by doing nothing'.
